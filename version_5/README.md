<h2>PLAYGROUND</h2>

Both demos are launched with the command

```
python server.py # works on localhost:5000 
```

> [!WARNING]  
> There's a lot to do here. It's just a sketch.

<b>GOAL : The goal is to answer the question of whether, by creating pieces of code, they can be written as blocks in space (in this case, as in the rect image on the canvas, somewhere in XY). Can then attempt to connect blocks together so that in this specific DEMO EXERCISE 1 and 2, the model can solve some problems, simple ones to start with? In this approach / exercise.</b>

<h3>Demo 1 </h3>

1. Save the text from the prompt. This will create a new entry in the "saved prompts" list below.
2. Click "Create group" and give it a name. This will create a new group in the next list below.
3. Select a group from the list; it will be highlighted in yellow in the "world" tab.
4. Click "add selected group."
5. Then click "add selected prompt to group." <br />
This creates a sequence like the one shown in the image:
1: #5 → 2: #6 → 3: #6 → 4: #6
6. You can play the sequence.

<h3>Demo 2 </h3>

Not working properly. Only these 3 steps work correctly. But here is the graph tab.

1. Switch to "realtime" mode
2. Save prompt
3. Click play to generate text
4. You can see the graph

<h2>A little help - two_nodes_rect_connect_demo.html</h2>

Helps calculate the distance between nodes. Works without starting an HTTP server. After drawing a rect and moving a node to the center, you can select "rect 1" in the right menu, for example, and move it around the plan to see its positions. And vectors.
