<h2>Version 2 - with pen and path analysis that automatically changes the destination to the node whose #ID we enter as destination</h2>

That's not very user-friendly. It's better to just have a stylus and draw nodes, so you can draw graphs freely. It would also be nice not to have to manually change the path's target after clicking playâ€”meaning you have to manually change each node, just let the system calculate new path for the current target. And that's exactly what's here, in version 2.
<br /><br />
start is the same.

```
python app.py
```

1. An example of using "Analyze Path." Here, the image shows current execution path in the graph.

2. Click the Analyze Path button, and a window will appear. Enter target node ID as shown in the image. The window obscures the #ID a bit, but it has #140 in it. The list doesn't show just the path for this specific path, it lists all of them.

3. Confirmation of path change.

<h3>The PEN example</h3>

1. Click PEN and the log window will open. Simply hover over the node, left-click, drag, and release.

2.  Once you release the left mouse button, a window will appear to enter your information. You can simply press SAVE, basic information has already been added automatically.

3. A new node in chain is added. Click on PEN (on) to exit drawing mode.
